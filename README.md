1.	User Access: The user opens the Liver Cirrhosis Prediction web app.
2.	Data Input: A form collects features such as age, alcohol consumption, medical history, etc.
3.	Model Prediction: The input is passed to a Random Forest classifier via Flask.
4.	Result Display: The model returns a prediction - "At Risk" or "Not at Risk".
5.	Advisory Output: A recommendation is provided regarding medical consultation.
The process is real-time, ensuring minimal delay between input and prediction.
